AI enhanced Art Therapy through Virtual Reality, to alleviate autism.

# Inspiration
Despite getting inspired by and lauding famous people who were born with some form of autism, like Albert Einstein and Mozart, Autism is highly stigmatised in our society. Studies suggest that people with autism are often highly visual thinkers, and many report that they “think in pictures”. Expressing feelings and ideas through images is very natural for such people and can be a welcome relief from the daily struggle to use words effectively. 
The traditional methods of "Special Attention" only makes them feel isolated and lonely. Art Therapy is a good approach but the people don't tend to express themselves freely due to fear of being judged and the sessions are more than they can afford.

# Thousand Words
We understand that AI can never replace human's feelings, but it can enhance our abilities to express ourselves better. Our app is divided into two parts: Artistic Creation and Artist-Audience Connection.

For artistic creation, it helps to translate the user's random drawings into a beautiful artwork, which not only help them to feel better, but also encourage them to express themselves. As the saying goes : A picture is worth a "Thousand Words".

As part of the artist-audience connection, our app provides a gallery to show and appreciate other autistic artists's artpieces. Looking at a peer’s art work offers a concrete way to “see” another person’s point of view and as the two share focus on the client’s art-making, a powerful bond can be forged without the initial need for direct, face-to-face interaction.

# Art Therapy
In recent years, caregivers seeking complimentary treatments which have a broader range of options available. One such treatment is art therapy. Broadly speaking, art therapy promotes mental and emotional growth through art making. It is conducted with the aim of building life skills, addressing deficits and problem behaviors, and promoting healthy self-expression. 

No man is a lonely island, Expression is out-coming  of your thoughts ,your internal behavior at peak. Some times it gives us happiness , we cheers,  we cry in sorrow, feel joy one of supreme feeling  when we are in love, feel angry when aggression is there.

Thousand Words is a Virtual Reality application that helps patients to explore and express themselves using art materials and crafting attractive artwork.
